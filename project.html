                                                        because of the slight skew caused by outliers so we do descrpitive analysis
                                                        to make sure that the outliers are within the expected limit.

                                                -4.3, which is (>2) and not acceptable, so we look further
                                                into it by finding out the outliers that are contributing
                                                the skew.

                                                Since our dataset has more than 80 records, we use +/- 3.29 as our measure.
                                                In that case we have 0.15% of values fall outside +/- 3.29. Therefore, it is 
                                                okay to treat this as Normal.

                    <h5>Reporting Normality for g_sc:</h5> 
    <p>
      g_sc was assessed for normality. Visual inspection of the histogram and QQ-Plot identified 
      some issues with skewness and kurtosis. The standardised score for kurtosis (-1.72)
      can be considered acceptable using the criteria proposed by West, Finch and Curran (1996), 
      but the standardised score for skewness (-4.32)  was outside the
      acceptable range.  However 100% of standardised scores for g_sc fall within the bounds
      of +/- 3.29, using the guidance of Field, Miles and Field (2013) the data can be considered 
      to approximate a normal distribution.

Null Hypothesis: All variances are equal.
Alternate Hypothesis: All variances are not equal.
From the test, we can see Pr(>F) is 0.01,which is less than 0.05, so it is statistically significant, thus rejecting null hypothesis(Homogeneity).

<p>
Multiple  regression  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine the global scores(g_sc).
Scores of Quantitative Reasoning and Critical Reading were used as predictor variables.
Examination of the histogram, normal P-P plot of standardised 
residuals and the  scatterplot  of  the  dependent  variable,  and
standardised  residuals  showed  that  some  outliers  existed.  However,
examination  of  the  standardised  residuals  showed  that  some  could  be
considered to have undue influence (95% within limits of -1.96 to plus 1.96
and none with Cook’s distance >1 as outlined in Field (2013).
Examination  for  multicollinearity  showed  that  the  tolerance  and  variance
influence factor measures were within acceptable levels (tolerance >0.4, VIF
< 2.5 ) as outlined in Tarling (2008). The scatterplot of standardised residuals
showed that the data met the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and
linearity.  The  data  also  meets  the  assumption  of  non-zero  variances  of  the
predictors.

The p-value indicates our model is significant, so we can reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternate hypothesis that the values of g_sc can be predicted with the predictor variables(cr_pro, qr_pro,school_nat) using Multiple linear Regression.

                        Increased marks in qr_pro and cr_pro  appears to be associated with increase marks in g_sc.

                        Our linear regression model is Predicted g_sc = 103 +  0.368*qr_pro + 0.471*cr_pro – 5.134*school_natPUBLIC

                    <li>
                        In our case using the standardised coefficients our model equation becomes: Predicted g_sc = 0 +  0.361*qr_pro + 0.563*cr_pro  - 0.11* school_natPUBLIC

                    <li>
                        When we calculate the equation for Public and Private schools:
<br>
Public   = 0+0.361+0.563-0.11=0.814 <br>
                    Private=0+0.361+0.563 =0.924
                    
                    </li>
                    <li>
We can see a small difference between the group yes and no.

                    </li>
                    <li>
We can see a slight change in the coefficent compared to model 1.

                    </li>
                    <li>
In our case adjusted r 2 value 0.724, which means around 72.4% of the variance g_sc can be explained by cr_pro and qr_pro when a dummy variable school_nat is added. An increase compared to model 1.

                        Research question 1, was successfully answered by creating a model to predict the global scores and the necessary
                        steps required to build said model are followed and the model is tested.
                    </li>
                    <li>Research question 2, was successfully answered by creating a model to predict the global scores and the differential effect
                        of school_nat has been analysed and added to the model and the model is tested.</li>

                        New research questions can be developed using other variables in the dataset like
                        the eng_s11, qr_s11, mat_s11 can be used to predict the eng_pro, qr_pro.
