           Almost <strong>impossible</strong> to perform analysis on large populations. <br>
           <strong>Parameter:</strong> A numerical value describing an aspect of an entire population

        <p>A subset of the population of interest; denoted n. <br>
          <strong>Statistics:</strong> A numerical value describing an aspect of a Sample <br>
           Parameters can be obtained by doing statistics on their samples, if more samples of a 
           population is available then the parameter values will be more accurate.  <br>

        <h3>Random Sample</h3>
        <p>A sample where each member is chosen from the population strictly by chance, which is 
          the ideal sample from a population and can give a more accurate results for the population
          if the random sample can charatcterise all the variables of the population.

          <h3>Infering a population from a sample:</h3>
          <p>
            We use statistics to infer the population parameters.

            Each samples would provide a different mean called sampling variation using which we  
            form a distribution called <strong>Sampling distribution</strong>
            
            This means if our distribution follows the normal distribution we can find the standard deviation
            of the sampling distribution(sample means) which is the Standard error of the mean
            <strong>(SE).</strong>

            <ul>

              <li><strong>Normal Distributions:</strong></li>
              Bell-shaped curve, with the values spread equally across the mean of the variable.
              <br>If the bell curve is sharp, it implies that the spread/deviation is less and the
              population mean is more closer to the sampling mean.
              <br><strong>Standard Normal:</strong> If the mean of the normal distribution is 0 and
              the standard deviation is 1 then it is said to be <strong>Standard Normal.</strong>
              <li><strong>Skewed:</strong>
              When the data points cluster more toward one side of the scale than the other, 
              creating a curve that is not symmetrical. It could be both positively skewed or negatively
              skewed.
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Positively skewed:</strong>When the data points cluster towards the left
              leading a tail on the right.It means that the outliers are to the right (long tail to 
              the right).</li>
              <li><strong>Negatively skewed:</strong>When the data points cluster towards the right
              leading a tail on the left. It means that the outliers are to the left.</li>
              <li><strong>Kurtosis:</strong>It shows the heaviness of the tail,which can be divided
              as <strong>Leptokurtic = heavy tails (more scores in the tails),
              Platykurtic = light tails (more scores in the middle).
              </strong></li>
                
            </ul>
            </ul>
            
          </p> 
          <strong>Central Limit Theorem:</strong>
          <p>The distribution of sample statistics is nearly normal,centered at the population mean,
            and with a standard deviation equal to the population standard deviation divided by square
            root of the sample size.
          </p>
          <strong>Conditions for CLT:</strong>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Independence:</strong>Sampled observations must be independent; random sample</li>
              <li><strong>Sample size/skew:</strong>Either the population distribution is normal,or if the
                population distribution is skewed,the sample size is large (rule of thumb:n >
                30).</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <strong>Confidence Interval</strong>
          <p>
            A plausible range of values for the population parameter is called a confidence interval.
            <strong>Note:</strong> <br>
            If we report a <strong>point estimate</strong>,we probably won’t hit the exact population parameter.
            <br>
            If we report a range of plausible values we have a good shot at capturing the parameter.
          </p>
          
          <strong>Z-score:</strong>
          <p>
            Standardized score to compare the probability of getting values in our measurement scale
            to standard normal.
            <br>
            For each raw scores, calculate how far it is from the mean in the units of S.D.
            <br> Distribution of Z-score is standard normal(i.e.) <strong>Mean =0, SD = 1</strong> 
          </p>

          <strong>Uses of Z-score:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Comparing Scores on different raw score scales.</li>
            <li>Showing how a given score stands in relation to overall set of scores.</li>
            <li>Using probability tables to calculate the likelihood of particular scores.</li>
          </ul>

          <strong>Properties of Z-scores:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>95% of z-scores lie between -1.96 to +1.96</li>
            <li>99% of z-scores lie between -2.58 to +2.58</li>
            <li>99.9% of z-scores lie between -3.29 to +3.29</li>
          </ul>

          <strong>Critical Values:</strong>
          <p>
            "Critical" values of z are associated with interesting central areas under the standard normal curve.
            The area under the curve between the critical points implies the probability that any normal 
            variable will have z-score between the said points.

            The critical value of z is term linked to the area under the standard normal model. Critical values
            can tell you what probability any particular variable will have.
            
            Critical z values are often denoted by zα, where the subscript α (alpha) is the tail area.

          </p>

          <strong>Representative Sample:</strong>
          <p>
            A representative sample is a subset of a population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics
            of the larger group. 
            <br>
            A representative sample is a small subset group that seeks to proportionally reflect
            specified characteristics exemplified in a target population.
            <br>
            Representative samples often yield the best results but they can be the most difficult
            type of sample to obtain.
            <br>
            When a sample is not representative, it can be known as a random sample. While random sampling
            is a simplified sampling approach, it comes with a higher risk of sampling error which can
            potentially lead to incorrect results or strategies that can be costly. Random sampling can
            choose its components completely at random, such as choosing names randomly from a list.
          </p>

          <h3>Key issues with Samples</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Biased Sampling:</strong> One of the most important issue with Sampling
            is Biased Sampling, which produces data that systematically differs from the population
            from which it is taken. This could degrade the integrity of the population parameter</li>
            <li><strong>Sample size:</strong>Which means the size of the sample subset from the population,
              <br>
              If the size is small, it might create problems when extrapolating conclusions for the population
              <br>
              If the size is large, it may lead to waste of resource, since a smaller sample could get the
            necessary conclusions</li>
            <li><strong>Randomness:</strong>Each variable/feature in the data should be as random
            as possible, with/without the researcher's knowledge it is possible to introduce bias in 
            the sample
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Experiments and Variable</h3>
        <p><strong>Experiments:</strong>The process using which we collect relevant measurements
        for statistics</p>
        <p><strong>Variable/Features:</strong>An attribute that describes a person, place, 
          thing, situation, or idea. 
          <br>
          The variables in the study/experiment should be reliable and valid.
          <br>
          <strong>Confounding Variables:</strong> Sometimes, it is pssible that the sample contains
          values which are influenced by other measurements which we included in the sample.
          These are called confounding variables.
        </p>

            <h3>Hyposthesis Testing:</h3>
            <p>
              A statistical method that uses sample data to evaluate a hypothesis about
              a population parameter. It is intended to help researchers  differentiate between 
              real and random patterns in the data.
            </p>


            <strong> Types of Hyposthesis testing:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Null Hyposthesis(H0):</strong>
              <p>
                It is a statemment regarding the values of unknown parameter, typically implies
                no association between independent and dependent variables in out theory.
                <br> All hypothesis testing starts with the null hypothesis.
                <br> Usually check for equality.
              </p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Alternate Hypothesis(Ha):</strong>
                <p>
                  Contradicting Null hypothesis, seeking evidence against H0;
                  <br> Usually checks for non-equality.
                </p>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Test Statistic:</strong>
              <p>
                A quantity based on the sample data and null hypothesis which allows us to 
                determine between null and alternate hypothesis
              </p></li>
            </ul>
            <strong>example:</strong>
            <p>
              If we again think of a hypothesis test as a criminal trial then it makes sense to
               frame the verdict in terms of the null and alternative hypotheses:
              <strong>
                <br> H0 :Defendant is innocent
                <br> HA :Defendant is guilty 
              </strong>

            <h3>Understanding the dataset: Student Performance Dataset</h3>
            <strong>Overview:</strong>
            <p>
              This dataset is about student achievement in secondary education of two Portuguese schools.
              <br>
              The features include student grades, demographic, social and school-related features) 
              and it was collected by using school reports and questionnaires.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Size of the dataset: 382 records</strong>
              </li>
              <li><strong>Representativeness of the dataset:</strong>
              <p>The dataset uses the data of students achievement in secondary educattion
                  but focusing on only two schools. Though it is not completely random rather focuses
                on the characteristics of the students involved in the dataset. </p>
                <p>So this sample, cannot extend to provide the population parameter.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Missing Data:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>It can reduce the representativeness of the samples. </li>
              <li>Missing data affects the validity of statistical analysis and can lead to invalid conclusions.
              </li>
              <li>It can occur due to errors, mistakes, or lack of foresight by the researcher or problems outside the control of the researcher </li>
              <li>Sometimes it can be deliberate added to change the statistics of the sample.</li>
              <li>“Real” missing data can seldom be classified into just one of the three (MCAR- Missing completely
                at Random, MAR- Missing At Random, MNAR- Missing Not At Random)</li>
            </ul>
            <ul><strong>Based on the Dataset:</strong>
              <li>In our case, there are no missing data at first glance. </li>
              <li>But on a closer look we can see some values are 0, this maybe caused due to several factors
                which include student absent during the exam.
              </li>
              <li> Since the percentage of these values for our variables of interest are very less, we will ignore it.</li>
              <li>Other methods of solving this problem may include imputing in which we impute the mean value 
                of the column to these missing values.

              <li><strong>Question:2</strong> Is there a Relationship between mG3 and students trying for higher education?</li>
              <li><strong>Question:3</strong> Is there a Relationship between mG3 and their study-time?</li>
              <li><strong>Question:4</strong> Is there a difference between students with different family size(less than 3 and greater than 3) in terms of whether they get family support?</li>
