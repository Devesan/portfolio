<h5>Reporting Normality for mG2:</h5> 
    <p>
        mG2 was assessed for normality. Visual inspection of the histogram and QQ-Plot identified 
        some issues with skewness and kurtosis. The standardised score for kurtosis (`r round(tpkurt[1]/tpkurt[2],2)`)
        can be considered acceptable using the criteria proposed by West, Finch and Curran (1996), 
        but the standardised score for skewness (`r round(mG2skew[1]/mG2skew[2],2)`)  was outside the
        acceptable range.  However 100% of standardised scores for total optimism and associated sensation fall within the bounds
        of +/- 3.29, using the guidance of Field, Miles and Field (2013) the data can be considered 
        to approximate a normal distribution.
    </p>
    <h5>Reporting Normality for mG3:</h5> 
    <p>
        mG3 was assessed for normality. Visual inspection of the histogram and QQ-Plot identified 
        some issues with skewness and kurtosis. The standardised score for kurtosis (`r round(tpkurt[1]/tpkurt[2],2)`)
        can be considered acceptable using the criteria proposed by West, Finch and Curran (1996), 
        but the standardised score for skewness (`r round(mG3skew[1]/mG3skew[2],2)`)  was outside the
        acceptable range.  However 100% of standardised scores for total optimism and associated sensation fall within the bounds
        of +/- 3.29, using the guidance of Field, Miles and Field (2013) the data can be considered 
        to approximate a normal distribution.
    </p>
<h5>Report for Research Question 1:</h5> 
<p>
The relationship between mG3(Final math grade achieved by students) and
mG2(math grade achieved in Grade 2) was investigated using a Pearson correlation. 
A strong positive correlation was found(r=0.90,n=380,p< 0.001).
</p>

<h5>Report for Research Question 2:</h5> 
<p>
"An independent-samples t-test was conducted to compare the mean scores of mG3 for students  who are trying
for higher education and those who do not. A significant difference in the scores for mG3 was found (
M=10.63, SD= 4.56 for students who are trying for higher studies , M= 5.50,SD= 4.64 for students who
are not trying for higher studies),(t(380)= -4.65, p = 0.01). A medium effect size was also indicated by
Cohen's d value (-0.48)."
</p>

<h5>Report for Research Question 3:</h5> 
<p>
A one-way between groups analysis of Variance(Anova) was conducted to explore the impact of study-time
of a student on mG3. study-time variable was divided in to 4 groups( Group: 1 - < 2 hours, Group: 2 - 2 to 5 hours, Group: 3 - 5 to 10 hours, or Group: 4 - >10 hours).
There was not statistically significant difference in the G3 scores, p>0.05, which is also statistically insignificant 
.The effect size was calculated using eta-squared was (0.08) which is small.
</p>
<h5>Report for Research Question 4</h5>
<p>
A Chi-Square test for independence (with Yates’ Continuity Correction) indicated no significant association
between students's family size and getting family support, χ2(1,n=380)=2.99,p=0.05, phi=0.084).
</p>
<h5>Reporting Multiple linear Regression(Model 2):</h5>
<p>
Multiple  regression  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine the student's final math grade(mG3)..
Marks obtained in second grade(mG2),going for higher studies(higher) were used as predictor variables.
In  order  to  include  the  higher education in the regression  model  it  was  recorded dummy variable
higher_edu  (0  for no, 1 for yes).Examination of the histogram, normal P-P plot of standardised 
residuals and the  scatterplot  of  the  dependent  variable,  academic  satisfaction,  and
standardised  residuals  showed  that  the  some  outliers  existed.  However,
examination  of  the  standardised  residuals  showed  that  none  could  be
considered to have undue influence (95% within limits of -1.96 to plus 1.96
and none with Cook’s distance >1 as outlined in Field (2013).
Examination  for  multicollinearity  showed  that  the  tolerance  and  variance
influence factor measures were within acceptable levels (tolerance >0.4, VIF
< 2.5 ) as outlined in Tarling (2008). The scatterplot of standardised residuals
showed that the data met the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and
linearity.  The  data  also  meets  the  assumption  of  non-zero  variances  of  the
predictors.

<h5>Reporting Multiple linear Regression(Model 3):</h5>
<p>
Multiple  regression  analysis  was  conducted  to  determine the student's final math grade(mG3)..
Marks obtained in second grade(mG2),going for higher studies(higher) were used as predictor variables
In  order  to  include  the  higher education in the regression  model  it  was  recorded dummy variable
higher_edu  (0  for no, 1 for yes) and an interaction term was introduced by multiplying (inthigher * mG2)
.Examination of the histogram, normal P-P plot of standardised 
residuals and the  scatterplot  of  the  dependent  variable,  academic  satisfaction,  and
standardised  residuals  showed  that  the  some  outliers  existed.  However,
examination  of  the  standardised  residuals  showed  that  none  could  be
considered to have undue influence (95% within limits of -1.96 to plus 1.96
and none with Cook’s distance >1 as outlined in Field (2013).
Examination  for  multicollinearity  showed  that  the  tolerance  and  variance
influence factor measures were outside acceptable levels (tolerance < 0.4, VIF
> 2.5 ) as outlined in Tarling (2008).
</p>
<h5>Report for Binary Logistic Regression Model:</h5>
<p>
Logistic  regression  analysis  was  conducted with higher studies as  the  outcome  variable 
and sex and romantic(is student in relationship?) was used as predictors. The data met the 
assumption for independent observations. Examination for multicollinearity showed that
the tolerance and variance influence factor measures were within  acceptable  levels  
(tolerance  >0.4,  VIF  < 2.5  )  as outlined  in  Tarling  (2008).  The  Hosmer  Lemeshow goodness
of fit statistic did not indicate any issues with the assumption of linearity between the independent variables
as and the log odds of the model (x<sup>2</sup>(n=1)=0.008, p =0.92).
</p>
<h5>Report for Dimension Reduction:</h5>
<p>
A principal component analysis (PCA) was conducted on the 20 items with orthogonal rotation (varimax).
Bartlett’s test of sphericity, Χ2(190) = 2381.718, p< 0.001, indicated that correlations between items
were sufficiently large for PCA. An initial analysis was run to obtain eigenvalues for each 
component in the data. Seven components had eigenvalues over Kaiser’s criterion of 1 and in
combination explained 68.87% of the variance.  The scree plot was slightly ambiguous and showed
inflexions that would justify retaining either 2 or 4 factors.  


The group D had an low reliability of Cronbach's α = 0.34 and the group E also had low reliability,
Cronbach’s α = .54
